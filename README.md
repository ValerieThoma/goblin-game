# goblin-game

## Synopsis

This game was built with Python during the second week of a sixteen week, Full Stack immersive coding course. 
It was made in jest and does not reflect the views or opinions of anyone but myself. 

## Code Example

I plan to revisit this code at the end of the course. My hope is that I can improve upon it by implementing all that I have
learned over the sixteen week course.

## Motivation

The narrative of this pygame is a hero's journey. Our hero, portrayed by Wonder Woman, must collect enough dollars to
represent equal pay for women. 
Our vilian, portrayed by a public figure who employs misogyny in his personal and professional life, will stop at nothing to prevent
our hero from accomplishing her mission. Help our hero achieve equity!

## License

I do not own any of the images or sounds utilized in the game.
